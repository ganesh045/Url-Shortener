# Url Shortener App : Angular SPA with Spring Boot

This Project can help us to generate short url from actual long range urls. We can add custom short url for actual urls as well.

### URL Conversion:

    We will encode the actual url by converting it from base 10 to base 62 convertion and vice versa.


1. Steps to run Angular application: 

   After project download/clone, go to UI/Shortener folder and run below commands

       npm install 
       ng serve

2. Steps to run the Spring Boot Server application:

   Go to Server folder , open ShortUrlGenerator folder with your IDE as MAVEN project and run below commands
   
       clean spring-boot:run

Once these two steps are done, we will be able to see the application startup on http://localhost:4200
